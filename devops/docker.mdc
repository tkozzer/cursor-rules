# Docker Best Practices

- Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size
- Use specific version tags, avoid 'latest'
- Run containers as non-root user
- Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files
- Scan images for vulnerabilities regularly
- Use minimal base images (alpine, distroless)
- Don't include secrets in images
- Use secrets management for sensitive data
- Optimize layer caching strategically
- Minimize the number of layers
- Use COPY instead of ADD when possible
- Clean up package manager caches
