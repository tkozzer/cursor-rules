# Vue.js Core Development Rules

- Use Vue 3 Composition API for all new projects
- Prefer script setup syntax for cleaner code
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Follow Vue.js style guide and best practices
- Use Single File Components (.vue files) exclusively
- Organize script, template, and style sections logically
- Keep components focused and small
- Use proper component naming conventions (PascalCase)
- Use ref() for primitive reactive values
- Use reactive() for objects and arrays
- Understand the difference between ref and reactive
- Use computed() for derived state
- Use watch/watchEffect for side effects
- Use v-for with unique keys always
- Prefer v-show over v-if for frequent toggles
- Use v-model for two-way binding appropriately
- Minimize complex expressions in templates
- Use v-memo for expensive list rendering
- Implement proper component lazy loading
- Use KeepAlive for expensive components
- Optimize large lists with virtual scrolling when needed
