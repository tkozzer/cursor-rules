# React Core Development Rules

- Use functional components with hooks exclusively
- Prefer composition over inheritance patterns
- Destructure props at the component level
- Use meaningful component and variable names
- Keep components small and focused on single responsibility
- Use TypeScript for all new React components
- Use arrow functions for component definitions
- Avoid inline object/function creation in JSX
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper dependency arrays in useEffect
- Use useMemo and useCallback judiciously for performance
- Implement error boundaries for component trees
- Use proper error states in components
- Handle loading and error states explicitly
- Follow React best practices and established patterns
